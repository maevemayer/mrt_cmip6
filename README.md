# mrt_cmip6
PhD kickoff project. Initial idea is to preselect CMIP6 / ICON events that have the necessary atmospheric variables to asses MSE_surf and MSE_sat at 500hPa. In a next step, we compute maximum reachable temperatures in these selected CMIP6 models, and investigate MSE dynamics when 50 degress C in Paris are met.
